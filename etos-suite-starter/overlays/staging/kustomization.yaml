# Having the sealed secret here is a workaround for secrets
# not generating a reload of pods.
# By loading the sealed secret into a generated
# configmap, the configmap will get a new name any time the
# sealed secret is changed resulting in a reload of the
# deployment.
# In order to have this behavior it was either this workaround
# or creating a plugin to kustomize. I chose this since this
# will work natively in ArgoCD.
