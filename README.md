# ETOS

ETOS (Eiffel Test Orchestration System) is a new test orchestration system which takes away control of how to run and what to run from the system itself and places it into the hands of the relevant engineers.

The idea of having a system dictate what and how to run is finished. Let's bring back control to the testers.

Please see the [documentation](./docs/index.md) for more information, tutorials and guides on how to use ETOS.

## Features

- Generic test suite execution based solely on JSON.
- Mix and match test suites, regardless of programming language.
- Separation of concerns between testers, test automation engineers and system engineers.
- Eiffel protocol implementation.
