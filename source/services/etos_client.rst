Main client for ETOS.

Github: `ETOS Client <https://github.com/eiffel-community/etos-client>`_

This page describes the ETOS client and its options as well as some examples of how it can be used. ETOS Client is a command-line tool that can be used in Continuous Integration tools such as jenkins as well as locally on workstations.

Why ETOS Client?
================

The ETOS client is a tool built to make it easier to execute ETOS (Eiffel Test Orchestration System). It is used for starting test suites in ETOS, and reporting the outcome.

General Syntax
--------------

The usage example below describes the interface of etos_client, which can be invoked with different combinations of options. The example uses brackets "[ ]" to describe optional elements. Together, these elements form valid usage patterns, each starting with the program's name etos_client.

Below the usage patterns, there is a table of the command-line options with descriptions. They describe whether an option has short/long forms (-h, --help), whether an option has an argument (--identity=<IDENTITY>), and whether that argument has a default value.

.. code-block:: bash

   etos_client [-h] -i IDENTITY -s TEST_SUITE [--no-tty] [-w WORKSPACE] [-a ARTIFACT_DIR] [-r REPORT_DIR] [-d DOWNLOAD_REPORTS] [--iut-provider IUT_PROVIDER] [--execution-space-provider EXECUTION_SPACE_PROVIDER] [--log-area-provider LOG_AREA_PROVIDER] [--dataset DATASET] [--cluster CLUSTER] [--version] [-v]
