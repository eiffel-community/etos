====================
ETOS Test Collection
====================

This page describes the ETOS test collection.

A test collection is how you trigger your tests. The test collection is a collection of recipes that are defined by the test automation engineers.
These recipes defines how ETOS will execute the tests.

This test collection is JSON file with several elements and can be quite tricky to create manually.


Structure
=========

Top-level properties
--------------------

.. code-block:: JSON

   [
      {
         "name": "Name of you suite",
         "priority": 1,
         "recipes": []
      }
   ]

.. list-table :: Top level properties

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description
   * - name
     - String
     - Test suite name. Will be referenced in the confidence level.
   * - priority
     - Integer
     - The execution priority. Unused at present and should be set to 1.
   * - recipes
     - List
     - The collection of test execution recipes. Each recipe is a test case.
